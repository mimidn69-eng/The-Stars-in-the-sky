  <h2>Short Story</h2>

  <div class="story">
    <p><strong>Every hundred years, the stars fall over the village of Elowen.</strong></p>

    <p>They don’t burn out like normal meteors. These stars glow with a gentle blue flame and drift down like feathers from the sky, humming softly, as if singing a song only the earth can hear.</p>

    <p>The villagers call it <strong>The Night of Wishes</strong>.</p>

    <p>According to legend, if you catch a falling star in your hands and whisper your truest desire, it will come true — but only if your heart is pure.</p>

    <p>Liora had waited her whole life for this night.</p>

    <p>She stood at the top of Windspire Hill, the highest point in Elowen, wearing a cloak stitched by her late mother. Her father had always scoffed at the stories. “Wishes don’t feed mouths,” he’d say, hauling wood through frostbitten mornings.</p>

    <p>But Liora believed.</p>

    <p>She didn’t want riches or fame. Her wish was simple: to find her brother, Cael, who had vanished during the last Falling — when she was only three.</p>

    <p>No one remembered him clearly anymore. Even their father had stopped speaking his name. But Liora had never forgotten the way Cael’s laughter echoed through the house, or the songs he sang to make her sleep.</p>

    <p>As midnight approached, the sky cracked open with light.</p>

    <p>Hundreds — no, thousands — of stars cascaded through the darkness. Gasps echoed from the village below. Liora held her breath.</p>

    <p>Then she saw it — a single star drifting toward her, slower than the rest, as if choosing her.</p>

    <p>She reached out.</p>

    <p>The star landed in her palms, warm and light, pulsing with a heartbeat not unlike her own. Liora leaned in close and whispered, “Bring Cael back.”</p>

    <p>The star flared white and disappeared.</p>

    <p>At first, nothing happened. She waited. The hill was quiet again.</p>

    <p>But then she heard footsteps behind her.</p>

    <p>She turned, expecting perhaps another villager — but there, silhouetted against the last falling lights, was a boy with storm-grey eyes.</p>

    <p>Older now. Worn by time. But unmistakable.</p>

    <p>“Cael?” she breathed.</p>

    <p>He nodded, eyes glassy with wonder. “I heard you,” he whispered. “Across all these years, I heard your wish.”</p>

    <p>They embraced as the final stars kissed the ground around them.</p>

    <p><strong>The magic of Elowen had spoken once more.</strong></p>
